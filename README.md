# Boxy!

Boxy is a simple platform physics game using [React Game Kit](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-game-kit).

The aim of the game is to get Boxy as high as possible by jumping from platform to platform, without falling off the bottom of the screen.

Left and right arrow keys roll. SPACE bar jumps.

Have fun!
